## I used to host a site called **iasonas.duckdns.org**.

## Problem:
**ISP now blocks ports 80 and 443**.
That means that it's hard to host a personal website without making a request.
Having incoming traffic in required ports (443 and 80) **may not be free**.

So this is the source code...

## What was the site:
It was a site for my **personal projects**.
People could **read documents** and **download apps** I made from there.
I was using [https://www.duckdns.org](url) for DNS,
**nginx** for server (software),
my **manjaro linux** personal computer as server(hardware)
and simple **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** and **BASH** for the site.

Hope ISP will not block ports for my java server that updates apps I made...

Also, now because of ISP, all my apps are broken because they were using this personal site.
Now I have to fix them all...
